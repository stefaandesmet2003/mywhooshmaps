# MyWhoosh Maps

If you like roaming free in the MyWhoosh worlds without getting lost, or if you like to know details about the upcoming climbs and sprints, this is the right place. The maps show the road network in each world, with elevations, the timed sprints and climbs, and points of interest to help navigation. See if you can find the hidden Paterberg Climb in Belgium!

MyWhoosh plays a few GPS tricks, as you may have noticed from exports to strava for example. In some worlds the GPS locations of the routes are far apart, or in other words, the same road will be recorded with different GPS coordinates, depending on the chosen route. In the Colombia world, some roads even have 90Â° rotation difference. Curious to know how mywhoosh will ever get strava segments working..

Anyway, for this reason, the maps here use one reference route in each world as a starting point. 

The data is not complete yet, a few routes and segments are still missing.

For viewing the raw gpx data I recommend the magnificent [gpx.studio](https://gpx.studio/).
The View | File Tree option is convenient, as is the option to hide/unhide tracks or points of interest under the left mouse button.
